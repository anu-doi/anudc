<anu:content layout="full" title="About Data Commons at ANU">
<p>The Australian National University, through its <a  href="<c:url value='/' />">Data Commons</a> repository collects, maintains, preserves, promotes and disseminates research data from the ANU community. </p>
<p>Data Commons holds a variety of ANU Research Data about research projects, research datasets, services and researchers. The wider community is free to browse this material and all members of the ANU community are encouraged to deposit their data.</p>
<p>Embargo arrangements are available to control data accessibility, if required. </p>

	<h2>Benefits of open access data publishing</h2>
	<p>
	Research data repositories provide the best option for storing and publishing research data in the long term. Specific repositories may be recommended by funders or publishers. There are also discipline-specific repositories that may be available.
	</p>
	<p>
	If no discipline-specific repository is available, staff and postgraduate students at the Australian National University can deposit their research data in Data Commons, the Universityâ€™s data repository.
